# VHDL Library

VHDL modules for constructing SoCs. No one should actually use these. I did a 
minimal amount of smokscreen testing, but nothing boyond that. Making perfect modules 
was not the point of this project... It would take far more time than I want to 
dedicate to do the verification work required for me to feel "very confident" 
that these work as intended. This project was stareted because I wanted to learn 
about the RISC-V architecture and have a somewhat interesting final product in 
the end.
