"examp_regs_pkg" and "examp_regs.vhd" are files that will be generated by the 
register manager program called "reggie" 

"examp_top.vhd" is an example of how a user would include the two generated 
files in his or her project. 

The "reggie" manager will create documentation and generic software drivers 
along with the vhdl files so that all of these files are in sync.
